# 🚀 NoSQL Showdown: Memcached vs Redis - The Ultimate Cache Rumble
Welcome to the "Battle of the Caches" research article! This project pits two heavyweight NoSQL caching systems—Memcached and Redis—against each other in a performance deathmatch. Who won? Well, let’s just say Memcached brought the speed, but Redis packed some fancy tricks.

# 📜 What’s Inside?
This article is your definitive guide to:

✅ Benchmarking Memcached & Redis in identical Docker containers (1 CPU core, 512MB RAM and 2 CPU core, 512MB RAM).

✅ Testing CRUD operations at three dataset sizes (10K, 100K, 1M items).

✅ Proving once and for all that Memcached is the Usain Bolt of caching (but Redis is the Swiss Army knife).

✅ Full performance metrics, graphs, and analysis—because raw numbers don’t lie.

# 🏆 Key Findings (Spoiler Alert!)
Memcached won in raw speed for basic CRUD ops. 🏎️💨

Redis is more versatile (but pays a tiny speed tax).
